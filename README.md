### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about building scaleable and efficient applications.
I enjoy diving deep into new concepts and applying them to my day to day work.

* I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer and Systems Engineering from [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Ilmenau](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/).
* I occasionally write articles about things I've learned, which you can read on [medium](https://medium.com/@tai.him18).
* I am happy to collaborate on any open-source libraries.

You can connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taihim/) or via [email](mailto:tai.him18@gmail.com)
